## Authentication

All email chatbot endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_session_id_here
```

The session ID is obtained from the OAuth login process and represents the user's authenticated session.

## Usage Examples

### Python Example

```python
import requests

# Get chatbot info
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8000/llm/email-chatbot/info",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your_session_id"}
)
info = response.json()
print(f"Capabilities: {info['capabilities']}")

# Send a query
response = requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8000/llm/email-chatbot/chat",
    headers={"Authorization": "Bearer your_session_id"},
    json={
        "message": "Show me my recent work emails"
    }
)
print(response.json()["message"])
```

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
// Get chatbot info
const infoResponse = await fetch('/llm/email-chatbot/info', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer your_session_id'
    }
});
const info = await infoResponse.json();
console.log('Capabilities:', info.capabilities);

// Send a query
const chatResponse = await fetch('/llm/email-chatbot/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer your_session_id',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        message: 'Show me my recent work emails'
    })
});
const result = await chatResponse.json();
console.log(result.message);
```

## Best Practices

### 1. **Stateless Design**
- No session management required - each request is independent
- No need to start or end sessions
- Each query is processed fresh with full context

### 2. **Query Optimization**
- Be specific in your queries for better results
- Use natural language rather than technical terms
- Combine multiple criteria for precise filtering

### 3. **Error Handling**
- Check response status codes
- Handle authentication errors gracefully
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

### 4. **Performance**
- Limit the number of emails returned for large datasets
- Use date ranges to narrow down searches
- Cache frequently requested data when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure you have a valid session ID from OAuth login
   - Check that the Bearer token is properly formatted
   - Verify the session hasn't expired

2. **No Results Found**
   - Try broader search criteria
   - Check if emails exist for the specified time period
   - Verify the user has access to the requested emails

3. **Tool Execution Errors**
   - Check if the email repository is accessible
   - Verify user permissions for email access
   - Ensure the LLM service is properly configured
